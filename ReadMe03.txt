ActiveX Control Tutorial Part (3 of 3)

Te tutorial is in Microsoft HTML Help format so anyone in 
Windows can open it.

The file got very big (1.2 MB)!! Therefore, I had to 
compress it with WinRAR and had to split it into 3 Parts.

I am sure that you will not regret downloading it!!

Elias Barbosa
